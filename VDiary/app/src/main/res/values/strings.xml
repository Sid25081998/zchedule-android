        Login Form, and your credentials are now cached for 3 minutes in the server and saved in your
        phone after successful login.

        information to your phone following VIT\'s FFCS Login Procedure again. This time your credentials
        are collected from your phone directly which was saved when login.

        We can assure you that, we neither collect or temper with any information in your FFCS. Our
